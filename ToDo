--- Operational value of Fabric
- Manageable data sets backup/restore
- scale out not up
- faster queries across TB data sets
- trade-off is some loss of graphiness, traveral across whole graph, and expandable nodes
- Keep full graph experience at the shard level figure out where shard size / graph value is at e.g. 3 months vs 1 month
- transactions to latest


-- 2x use cases
- federated databases for fraud rings
  -- security not an issue for this type of federation
  - data set harder to fake (may be one for the future)
- sharded databases for fraud structuring (focus of session)

--- Explain the model --- DONE
Create a transaction set - DONE
Create a customer accounts set - DONE
Import using Importer - DONE

--- Migrating from a single graph to shards ---
Do the labelling for the Shards - DONE
Shard the transactions - DONE


--- Setup and deploying Fabric ---
Explain configuration - DONE
Set up Fabric with Local PARTITIONS only config - using Docker - DONE - improved docs - 5.0 feature will be available in Cypher
Set up Fabric with Local PARTITIONS only config - using Desktop / Browser only - DONE (re-use config from Docker)
Set up Fabric with REMOTE databases in Kubernetes - DONE - able to demostrate and use REMOTE feature available in 4.4.x - POSSIBLY in time for GA


--- Introduce Fabric Queries ---
Unwind through graph ids, get some data across each shard - DONE

--- Comparing the Graph vs Fabric experience ----
Create a query to find all the accounts that a suspected fraudster has transacted with - CAN DO
Create a fabric query to find all the accounts that a suspected fraudster has transacted with - CAN DO


--- Pros / Cons of Starting Shard vs Starting Unsharded
Downtime migration - copy requires off-line
User experience gap - dont give people something then take it away
Give them something and sell them on the future
vs
Starting with sharding requires a different effort in the model - need to think about where data goes
, plus may incur higer risk in deal

2x clear cases where can work
1) transactions over time e.g. banking, potentially other time series?? - DONE
2) federated graphs WHERE you know that the security boundary is the SAME - DONE

--- Gotchas ----
Things that may catch you out along the way, error messages etc

--- Advanced Session 2 ---

--- Find Fraud ---
Create a fraudulent transaction set - NOT DONE - Q? Can I
Create a query to find the fraud - NOT DONE - Wont be DONE
Create a fabric query to find the fraud - NOT DONE - Unlikely
