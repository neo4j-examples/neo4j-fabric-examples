Given this is just a function - Can we provide a fabric function for unique id that can be used?


---QUESTION why doesnt this just return the date time of the max transaction, instead get a list of transactions
UNWIND fabric.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE fabric.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (t:Transaction)
  RETURN t.amount AS amount, t.id as id, t.dateTime as dateTime
}
RETURN max(amount) AS maxT, dateTime




Do you test Fabric with many K8S pods all running the same application, each POD being dynamically created and destroyed, each calling Neo4j independently?
- this is about restarting the fabric mach to add new instances


Use fabric with Aura, cut over from on prem to cloud
- use for migration
- use for DR
