Error: Database "shard8" is unavailable, its status is "offline".
Clears after neo4j DBMS has been restarted 
Cause: have you copied the data as ROOT? Make sure files are owned by neo4j user

Execute command
UNWIND fabric.graphIds() AS graphId
CALL {
  USE fabric.graph(graphId)
  MATCH (n)
  RETURN n  AS title
}
RETURN title

Error: Unable to get a routing table for database 'shard7' because this database does not exist
Cause: You cant query databases in fabric if the target database does exist

When attempting to query an Aura database
Error: Remote execution failed with code N/A and message 'Could not perform discovery for database 'neo4j'. No routing server available.'

Connection to the database terminated. Please ensure that your database is listening on the correct host and port and that you have compatible encryption settings both on Neo4j server and driver. Note that the default encryption setting has changed in Neo4j 4.0.

Cause: For Aura you need the security settings in neo4j.conf
